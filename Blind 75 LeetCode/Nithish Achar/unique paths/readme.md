## Explanation of the Code for Finding Unique Paths in a Grid

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `uniquePaths` that takes two integers `m` and `n` as input and returns the number of unique paths a robot can take in a grid from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.

**Problem:**

Given a grid with dimensions `m x n`, where the robot can only move right or down at each step, find the total number of unique paths the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner from the top-left corner.

**Solution Approach:**

The code utilizes dynamic programming (DP) to solve this problem efficiently. DP involves storing solutions to subproblems and using them to solve larger problems. Here's a breakdown of the code:

```java
class Solution {
  public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
    // Create a 2D array to store the number of unique paths to each cell.
    int[][] dp = new int[m][n];

    // Initialize the values for the first row and first column to 1.
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      dp[i][0] = 1;
    }
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      dp[0][j] = 1;
    }

    // Fill the dp array by summing up the number of paths from the top and left cells.
    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
      for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
      }
    }

    // The value at dp[m - 1][n - 1] represents the number of unique paths from (0,0) to (m-1,n-1).
    return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
  }
}
