# Code Explanation: Insert Interval - Python Solution

## Explanation:

- The function insert takes a list of intervals (intervals) and a new interval (newInterval) to insert into the list.
- The new interval is appended to the existing intervals list.
- The intervals list is sorted based on the start time of each interval.
- A new list ans is initialized with a dummy interval [-1, -1].
- Iterate through the sorted intervals list:
1. If the end time of the last interval in ans is greater than or equal to the start time of the current interval, merge them by updating the end time to the maximum of the two end times.
2. Otherwise, append the current interval to ans.
- Return ans[1:] to remove the dummy interval.

## Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
