# Problem Analysis
We are given a matrix of integers. If an element in the matrix is 0, we need to set its entire row and column to 0.

# Approach
1. We iterate through the matrix and mark the first row and first column where we find 0s. We use two flags to denote if the first row and first column need to be set to 0 later.
2. We iterate through the matrix again, except for the first row and first column. If we find a 0, we set the corresponding first row and first column elements to 0.
3. Finally, we iterate through the matrix again, except for the first row and first column. If any element in the first row or first column is 0, we set the current element to 0.
4. If the flags for the first row or first column were set earlier, we set all elements in the first row or first column to 0 accordingly.

# Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(N * M), where N is the number of rows and M is the number of columns in the matrix. We iterate through the matrix multiple times but without nested loops.
- Space Complexity: O(1), since we're using constant extra space.
