# Intuition
The problem requires determining whether a given linked list contains a cycle. We can use the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm, also known as the two-pointer technique, to efficiently detect cycles in the linked list.

# Approach
1. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - Initialize two pointers, fast and slow, both pointing to the head of the linked list.
   - Move the fast pointer by two steps and the slow pointer by one step in each iteration.
   - If there is a cycle in the linked list, the fast pointer will eventually meet or overlap with the slow pointer.
   - If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list (i.e., fast == nil or fast.Next == nil), there is no cycle in the linked list.

2. **Detection of Cycle**:
   - Iterate through the linked list using the fast and slow pointers.
   - At each iteration, move the fast pointer by two steps and the slow pointer by one step.
   - If the fast and slow pointers meet (fast == slow), a cycle is detected, and the function returns true.
   - If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list (fast == nil or fast.Next == nil), indicating no cycle, the function returns false.

# Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.
  - In the worst case, both pointers traverse the entire list once.
- Space Complexity: O(1).
  - The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
