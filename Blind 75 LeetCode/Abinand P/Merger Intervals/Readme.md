## Class: Solution

This class contains a method `merge()` to merge overlapping intervals in a 2D vector of intervals.

### Method: `merge`

Merges overlapping intervals in a 2D vector of intervals.

#### Parameters

- `intervals`: A 2D vector of integers representing the input intervals.

#### Returns

A 2D vector of integers representing the merged intervals.

#### Approach

1. **Sort Intervals:**
   - Sort the input `intervals` vector based on the start times of the intervals.

2. **Merge Overlapping Intervals:**
   - Initialize an empty vector `ans` to store the merged intervals.
   - Iterate through the sorted `intervals` vector.
   - If `ans` is empty or the start time of the current interval is greater than the end time of the last interval in `ans`, add the current interval to `ans`.
   - Otherwise, update the end time of the last interval in `ans` to be the maximum of its current end time and the end time of the current interval.

3. **Return Result:**
   - Return the merged intervals stored in `ans`.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this method is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of intervals, due to the sorting step.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity of this method is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of intervals, as it stores the merged intervals in the `ans` vector.
