Initialization:

left is initialized to 0, which represents the leftmost index of the array.
right is initialized to len(height) - 1, which represents the rightmost index of the array.
ans is initialized to 0, which will store the maximum area found.
While Loop:

The loop continues until left is less than right.
Calculate the Area:

min_ = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
This calculates the area of water that can be held between the lines at indices left and right.
min(height[left], height[right]) ensures that the height of the water is limited by the shorter line (since water cannot overflow).
(right - left) is the width of the container.
ans = max(ans, min_)
This updates ans to be the maximum area found so far.
Move the Pointers:

If the height at left is less than the height at right, increment the left pointer. This is because moving the shorter line might give a chance to find a taller line and potentially a larger area.
Otherwise, decrement the right pointer. This is because if the line at right is shorter or equal, moving the right pointer to the left might give a chance to find a taller line.
Return the Maximum Area:

Once the loop finishes, ans will contain the maximum area found, which is then returned.
