This code is a solution to the "Two Sum" problem on LeetCode. The problem statement typically asks you to find two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target number and return their indices. 
Approach:

num_indices is a dictionary where the keys are the numbers from the input array nums, and the values are their indices.
We iterate through nums using the enumerate() function, which provides both the index i and the value num at that index.
For each num, we calculate its complement, which is the number needed to reach the target sum (target - num).
We check if the complement exists in num_indices. If it does, it means we have found two numbers whose sum equals the target. We return their indices.
If the complement is not in num_indices, we add the current num to num_indices with its index i. This step ensures that we can later check if a number's complement exists in the dictionary when we encounter that complement in the array.
If no solution is found after iterating through the entire array, it implies there are no two numbers that add up to the target, and thus, we return an empty list or None.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) because it iterates through the array only once, and the dictionary lookup operation is O(1) on average.
