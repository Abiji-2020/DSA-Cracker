This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `search` that performs a linear search for a target value within a list of numbers (`nums`). Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. The method `search` takes two parameters: `nums`, which is the list of numbers to search within, and `target`, which is the value to search for.

2. It iterates through each index of the list `nums` using a for loop and the `range` function. The loop variable `x` iterates over indices from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`.

3. Inside the loop, it checks if the value at the current index (`nums[x]`) is equal to the target value (`target`). If it finds a match, it immediately returns the index `x`, indicating the position of the target value within the list.

4. If the loop completes without finding the target value, it means the target value is not present in the list. In this case, it returns `-1` to indicate that the target value was not found.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list `nums`, because it performs a linear search by iterating through each element of the list sequentially until it finds the target value or reaches the end of the list.
