This solution aims to determine whether an array contains any duplicates. It sorts the array in ascending order and then iterates through it, comparing each element with the one next to it.

1. Sort the input array `nums` in non-decreasing order using the `sort()` method. Sorting the array allows us to easily identify duplicates as they will appear adjacent to each other after sorting.

2. Iterate through the array using a for loop. We iterate over the range of indices from 0 to `n - 2`, where `n` is the length of the array. We stop at `n - 2` to ensure that when we access `nums[i + 1]` inside the loop, we do not go out of bounds.

3. Within the loop, compare the current element `nums[i]` with the next element `nums[i + 1]`. If they are equal, it means we have found a duplicate. In this case, return `True` immediately, indicating that the array contains duplicates.

4. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, it means there are no adjacent equal elements in the sorted array, and hence no duplicates exist. In this case, return `False` to indicate that the array does not contain any duplicates.

By sorting the array and then checking adjacent elements, this solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of elements in the array. The space complexity is O(1) since the sorting is performed in-place and no additional space is used other than a few variables for iteration.
