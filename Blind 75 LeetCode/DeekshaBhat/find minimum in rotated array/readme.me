This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `findMin`. The `findMin` method takes a list of numbers `nums` as input and returns the minimum value from that list using the `min()` function.


1. `class Solution(object):`: This line defines a class named `Solution`. In Python, classes are used to create objects that bundle together data and functions that operate on that data. The `(object)` part indicates that `Solution` is inheriting from the base object class in Python.

2. `def findMin(self, nums):`: This line defines a method named `findMin` inside the `Solution` class. It takes two arguments: `self`, which refers to the instance of the class, and `nums`, which is a list of numbers.

3. `return min(nums)`: This line returns the minimum value from the list `nums` using the `min()` function. The `min()` function takes an iterable (such as a list) as input and returns the smallest element in that iterable.

In summary, this code snippet defines a class with a method to find the minimum value in a list of numbers.
