1. Class Definition: 
   - The code defines a class named `Solution`.

2. Method Definition:
   - Inside the `Solution` class, there is a method named `getSum` which takes two integer parameters `a` and `b`.
   - This method returns an integer.

3. While Loop:
   - The `while` loop runs as long as the value of `b` is not equal to 0.
   - This loop will handle the addition and subtraction process.

4. If-Else Statement:
   - Inside the `while` loop, there is an `if-else` statement.
   - If `b` is greater than 0, it means we need to add 1 to `a` and subtract 1 from `b`.
   - If `b` is less than 0, it means we need to add 1 to `b` and subtract 1 from `a`.
   - This logic ensures that we perform addition or subtraction based on the sign of `b`.

5. Return Statement:
   - Finally, after the loop completes, the method returns the value of `a`.

Overall, this method aims to calculate the sum of two integers `a` and `b` by incrementing `a` while decrementing `b`, or vice versa, based on the sign of `b`.
