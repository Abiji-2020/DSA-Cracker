This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `maxSubArray` that takes a list of numbers `nums` as input and returns the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `nums`.

1. It initializes two variables: `maxSub` to store the maximum sum found so far, initialized with the first element of the input list `nums`, and `curSum` to keep track of the current sum of the subarray being considered, initially set to 0.

2. It iterates through each element `n` in the input list `nums`.

3. Inside the loop, it checks whether the current sum `curSum` is negative. If it is, that means starting a new subarray from the current element would yield a larger sum than continuing the current subarray, so it resets `curSum` to 0.

4. It then adds the current element `n` to `curSum` to update the current sum.

5. It updates `maxSub` with the maximum of `maxSub` and `curSum`. This ensures that `maxSub` always holds the maximum sum found so far.

6. After the loop finishes, it returns the maximum sum found, which is stored in `maxSub`.

This algorithm essentially finds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within the given list of numbers by considering all possible subarrays and keeping track of the maximum sum encountered so far. The dynamic programming approach is used here to efficiently find the maximum subarray sum.
