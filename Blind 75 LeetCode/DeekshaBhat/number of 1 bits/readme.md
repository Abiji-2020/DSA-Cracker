This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `hammingWeight`. The purpose of this method is to count the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of the input integer `n`. 

1. `bin(n)`: This converts the integer `n` into its binary representation as a string. For example, if `n` is 10, `bin(n)` would return '0b1010' because 10 in binary is '1010'.

2. `.count('1')`: This function counts the occurrences of the character '1' in the binary representation obtained in step 1. Since the binary representation is a string, the `count` method simply counts how many times the character '1' appears in that string.

3. `return`: This statement returns the count of '1' bits in the binary representation of the input integer `n`.

So, in essence, this code calculates the Hamming weight, which is the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of the given integer `n`, by converting `n` to binary and counting the occurrences of '1'.
