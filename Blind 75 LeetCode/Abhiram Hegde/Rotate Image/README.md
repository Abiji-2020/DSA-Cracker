## Explanation of Matrix Rotation Algorithm

The provided Java code implements a method to rotate a given square matrix `matrix` by 90 degrees clockwise. Here's a breakdown of the algorithm:

1. **Transpose the Matrix**: 
   - The first nested loop transposes the matrix. It iterates over each row and each column, starting from the top-left corner.
   - For each element at position `(i, j)`, it swaps the element at `(i, j)` with the element at `(j, i)`.
   - This operation effectively transposes the matrix.

2. **Reverse Each Row**:
   - After transposing the matrix, the second nested loop iterates over each row.
   - Within each row, it swaps elements symmetrically around the center column.
   - For each element at position `(i, j)`, it swaps the element with its symmetric counterpart, which is at position `(i, n-1-j)`, where `n` is the size of the matrix.
   - This operation effectively reverses each row of the transposed matrix, resulting in a clockwise rotation.

The overall effect of these two steps is to rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N^2), where N is the size of the matrix. This is because there are two nested loops, each iterating over N elements.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of extra space for temporary variables, regardless of the size of the input matrix.
