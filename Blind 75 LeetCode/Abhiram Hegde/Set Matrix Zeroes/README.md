### Explanation of setZeroes Method

#### Method Overview:
This method modifies a given 2D matrix by setting entire rows and columns to zero if any element in that row or column is zero.

#### Algorithm:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Get the dimensions of the matrix (`m` rows and `n` columns).
   - Initialize boolean flags `firstRowHasZero` and `firstColHasZero` to false.

2. **Check for Zeros in First Row and Column**:
   - Loop through the first row and column to determine if any elements are zero. Update the flags accordingly.

3. **Mark Rows and Columns with Zeros**:
   - Iterate through the matrix, starting from the second row and column.
   - If an element at position `[i][j]` is zero, set the corresponding elements in the first row (`matrix[0][j]`) and first column (`matrix[i][0]`) to zero. These will serve as flags.

4. **Set Zeroes in Matrix**:
   - Traverse the matrix again, excluding the first row and column.
   - If the flag in the first row or column for the current row or column is zero, set all elements in that row or column to zero.

5. **Handle First Row and Column**:
   - If `firstRowHasZero` is true, set all elements in the first row to zero.
   - If `firstColHasZero` is true, set all elements in the first column to zero.

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n)**: The algorithm traverses the entire matrix twice, once to mark rows and columns with zeros and once to set the zeros in the matrix.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space for boolean flags.
