## Explanation of Level Order Traversal Algorithm

### Code Overview

The provided code implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to perform level order traversal on a binary tree. The traversal visits each level of the tree from top to bottom and left to right, storing the nodes' values in a list of lists.

### Code Breakdown

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Create an empty list of lists `result` to store the nodes' values at each level.
   - Check if the `root` of the tree is null. If so, return the empty result list.
   - Create a queue `queue` to perform BFS and add the `root` node to it.

2. **BFS Iteration**:
   - While the queue is not empty, continue the BFS traversal.
   - For each level of the tree:
     - Create an empty list `level` to store the values of nodes at this level.
     - Get the size of the current level by querying the size of the queue (`levelSize`).
     - Iterate through the nodes in the current level (based on `levelSize`):
       - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.
       - Add the value of the dequeued node to the `level` list.
       - Enqueue the left and right child nodes (if they exist) into the queue.
     - After processing all nodes at the current level, add the `level` list to the `result` list of lists.

3. **Return Result**:
   - After traversing all levels of the tree, return the `result` list containing the nodes' values at each level.

### Time Complexity

- **Traversal**: 
  - Each node is visited once, so the time complexity of the traversal is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

### Space Complexity

- **Queue**: 
  - The space complexity is O(n), where n is the maximum number of nodes at any level of the tree.
  - In the worst case, the queue can hold all the nodes at the last level of a completely unbalanced tree, which results in O(n) space complexity.
