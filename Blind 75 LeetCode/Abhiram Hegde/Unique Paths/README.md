**Class Solution:**

This class defines a single method `uniquePaths(m, n)`, which calculates the number of unique paths a robot can take in a grid to reach the bottom-right corner.

**Method Breakdown:**

**1. Define Dynamic Programming (DP) Array:**

- Creates a 2D integer array `dp` with dimensions `m x n` to store the number of unique paths reaching each cell.

**2. Initialize First Row and Column:**

- Iterates through the first row (`i = 0` to `m-1`) and sets `dp[i][0]` to 1. This signifies there's only one path to reach any cell in the first column, as the robot can only move down from there.
- Similarly, iterates through the first column (`j = 0` to `n-1`) and sets `dp[0][j]` to 1. This represents the single path to reach any cell in the first row, as the robot can only move right from there.

**3. Fill DP Array:**

- Iterates through the remaining cells of the grid (`i = 1` to `m-1` and `j = 1` to `n-1`).
- For each cell `dp[i][j]`, the number of unique paths is calculated by adding:
    - The number of unique paths to reach the cell above (`dp[i-1][j]`) and
    - The number of unique paths to reach the cell to the left (`dp[i][j-1]`).

**4. Return Result:**

- After filling the `dp` array, `dp[m-1][n-1]` represents the number of unique paths reaching the bottom-right corner cell. This value is returned as the final result.

**Summary:**

This code utilizes dynamic programming to efficiently solve the problem of finding unique paths in a grid. It leverages the principle of sub-problems, building upon the solutions to smaller sub-grids to determine the solution for the entire grid.
