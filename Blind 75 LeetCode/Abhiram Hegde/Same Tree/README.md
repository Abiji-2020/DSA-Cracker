**Explanation:**
- The `isSameTree` method takes in two `TreeNode` objects, `p` and `q`, representing the roots of two binary trees.
- The method recursively compares the two trees to determine if they are identical.
- If both `p` and `q` are `null`, it means the subtrees are identical, so it returns `true`.
- If either `p` or `q` is `null`, or if their values are different, it means the trees are not identical, so it returns `false`.
- Otherwise, it recursively calls `isSameTree` on the left subtrees and right subtrees of `p` and `q`.
- If both recursive calls return `true`, it means the left and right subtrees of both trees are identical, so it returns `true`.

**Time Complexity:**  
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the total number of nodes in the smaller of the two trees. This is because the algorithm traverses each node of both trees once in the worst case.

**Space Complexity:**  
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(h), where h is the height of the smaller of the two trees. This is because the algorithm uses a recursive call stack, which can grow up to the height of the smaller tree.
