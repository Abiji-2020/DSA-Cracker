## Explanation of the minWindow method

### Inputs:
- `s`: The input string from which the minimum window substring is to be found.
- `t`: The target string whose characters should be present in the minimum window substring.

### Steps:
1. Check if the length of `s` is less than the length of `t`. If it is, return an empty string because it's impossible for `s` to contain `t`.
2. Create a frequency map `tFreq` to store the frequency of characters in string `t`.
3. Initialize variables:
   - `required`: The number of unique characters in `t`.
   - `left` and `right`: Pointers for the sliding window.
   - `formed`: Count of characters in the current window that match the characters in `t`.
   - `windowFreq`: Frequency map to store the characters in the current window.
   - `result`: Array to store the minimum window substring's length, start index, and end index.

### Sliding Window Approach:
1. Iterate through string `s` using the `right` pointer.
2. Update the frequency map `windowFreq` for the character at `right` pointer.
3. If the current character exists in `t` and its frequency matches that in `tFreq`, increment `formed`.
4. Inside a nested while loop, move the `left` pointer until the window no longer satisfies the condition.
   - Update the `result` if a smaller window is found.
   - Update `windowFreq` and decrement `formed` accordingly.
5. Increment the `right` pointer to continue sliding the window.
6. Finally, return the minimum window substring found using the `result` array.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(|s| + |t|), where |s| is the length of string `s` and |t| is the length of string `t`. 
- The algorithm iterates through string `s` once with two pointers (`left` and `right`), each moving at most |s| times. 
- Within the inner while loop, the `left` pointer can also iterate at most |s| times in total.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of this algorithm is O(|s| + |t|).
- We use two HashMaps (`tFreq` and `windowFreq`) to store the frequency of characters in strings `t` and the current window, respectively.
- Additionally, the `result` array has a constant space complexity.
