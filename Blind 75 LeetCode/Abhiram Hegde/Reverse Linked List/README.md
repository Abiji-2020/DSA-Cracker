**Explanation**

This Java code implements a `Solution` class that reverses a linked list. It provides two functions to achieve this:

1. `reverseList(self, head)`: This function iteratively reverses the linked list.
2. `reverseListRecursive(self, head)`: This function recursively reverses the linked list.

**Iterative Approach (reverseList)**

The `reverseList` function employs an iterative approach to reverse the linked list. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Two pointers, `prev` and `current`, are initialized. `prev` is set to `null` initially, and `current` is set to the `head` of the linked list.

2. **Iterative Reversal:**
   - A `while` loop continues as long as `current` is not `null`.
     - Inside the loop:
       - A temporary variable, `nextNode`, stores the `next` pointer of the current node.
       - The `next` pointer of the current node is rewired to point to the `prev` node, effectively reversing the direction.
       - `prev` is then updated to the current node, and `current` is moved to the `nextNode`.

3. **Return the New Head:**
   - After the loop completes, `prev` will be pointing to the new head of the reversed linked list, as it was the last `current` node. This new head is returned by the function.

**Recursive Approach (reverseListRecursive)**

The `reverseListRecursive` function implements a recursive approach to reverse the linked list. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Base Case:**
   - If the `head` is `null` or the `next` pointer of the `head` is `null`, it signifies an empty list or a single-node list. In this case, the function simply returns the `head` as the reversed list remains the same.

2. **Recursive Reversal:**
   - A new head (`newHead`) is obtained by recursively calling `reverseListRecursive` on the `next` node of the current `head`. This call reverses the remaining portion of the linked list from the second node onwards.

3. **Reverse the First Two Nodes:**
   - After the recursive call, the `next.next` pointer of the `newHead` (which is the last node in the reversed portion) is set to point to the current `head`. This connects the reversed portion to the original head node.

4. **Complete Reversal:**
   - The `next` pointer of the current `head` is set to `null` to terminate the connection with the rest of the original list.

5. **Return the New Head:**
   - Finally, the `newHead` (which is now the head of the reversed linked list) is returned by the function.

**Time Complexity**

Both iterative (`reverseList`) and recursive (`reverseListRecursive`) approaches have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because each node is visited and processed once during the reversal process.

**Space Complexity**

- **Iterative Approach (`reverseList`):** The iterative approach uses only constant extra space for the `prev` and `current` pointers. Therefore, its space complexity is O(1).
- **Recursive Approach (`reverseListRecursive`):** The recursive approach incurs space complexity due to the call stack. With each recursive call, a new frame is added to the stack, storing the function arguments and local variables. In the worst case (when the linked list has n nodes), the depth of the recursion will be n. Hence, the space complexity of the recursive approach is O(n).
