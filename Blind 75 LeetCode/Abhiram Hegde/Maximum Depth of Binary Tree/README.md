### Explanation:

1. The `maxDepth` method takes a `TreeNode` named `root` as input and returns an integer representing the maximum depth of the binary tree.

2. If the `root` is `null`, it means the tree is empty, so the depth is 0, and the method returns 0.

3. If the `root` is not `null`, the method recursively calculates the depth of the left subtree and stores it in `leftDepth`, and recursively calculates the depth of the right subtree and stores it in `rightDepth`.

4. The method then returns the maximum of `leftDepth` and `rightDepth`, plus 1, to account for the current node, as we're counting edges. This represents the maximum depth of the tree rooted at the current node.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because in the worst case, we visit every node exactly once.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. This is because the recursive calls consume stack space proportional to the height of the tree. In the worst-case scenario, the tree is completely unbalanced, leading to a space complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes. However, in a balanced binary tree, the space complexity is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes.
