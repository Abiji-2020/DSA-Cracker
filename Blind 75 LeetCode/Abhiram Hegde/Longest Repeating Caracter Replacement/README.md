The given Java code defines a class `Solution` with a method `characterReplacement` that takes a string `s` and an integer `k` as input parameters and returns an integer.

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: 
    - Initialize variables `n` as the length of string `s`, `maxFreq` as 0, `left` and `right` as 0, and an array `charCount` of size 26 to store the count of each character.
2. **Sliding Window Approach**:
    - Use a sliding window approach where `left` and `right` pointers define the current window.
3. **While Loop**:
    - Iterate through the string `s` until `right` pointer reaches the end.
4. **Updating Character Count**:
    - Increment the count of the character at index `right` in the `charCount` array.
    - Update `maxFreq` by taking the maximum of its current value and the count of the current character.
5. **Check Condition**:
    - Check if the length of the current window (`right-left+1`) minus the maximum frequency of any character in the window (`maxFreq`) is greater than `k`.
    - If it is, then we need to reduce the window size by moving the `left` pointer to the right until the condition is satisfied.
6. **Update Left Pointer**:
    - Decrement the count of the character at index `left` in the `charCount` array.
    - Increment `left` pointer to shrink the window.
7. **Increment Right Pointer**:
    - Increment `right` pointer to expand the window.
8. **Return Result**:
    - Return the length of the longest substring with all characters replaced.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the given solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. This is because the solution iterates through the string once with two pointers (`left` and `right`) and performs constant-time operations within the loop.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of the given solution is O(1), because the extra space used (such as the `charCount` array) is of constant size (26 in this case), and it does not depend on the size of the input string. Therefore, the space complexity remains constant irrespective of the input size.
