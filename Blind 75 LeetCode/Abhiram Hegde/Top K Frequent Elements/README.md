## Explanation of the code:

The given Java code is a solution to find the top k frequent elements in an array of integers.

1. **HashMap**: 
   - The code first creates a HashMap named `map` to store the frequency of each element in the input array `nums`. 
   - It iterates through each element `num` in the `nums` array and updates its frequency in the HashMap.

2. **PriorityQueue**: 
   - Next, a `PriorityQueue` named `pq` is created. This PriorityQueue is initialized with a custom comparator `(a, b) -> map.get(b) - map.get(a)`. 
   - This comparator ensures that elements are ordered based on their frequency in descending order. 

3. **Populating PriorityQueue**: 
   - After the HashMap is populated, the code iterates through each key (element) in the HashMap and adds it to the PriorityQueue `pq`.

4. **Getting top k frequent elements**: 
   - The code then creates an array named `result` of size `k`.
   - It iterates `k` times and each time, it polls (removes and returns) the top element (element with highest frequency) from the PriorityQueue `pq` and assigns it to the corresponding index in the `result` array.

5. **Returning the result**: 
   - Finally, the `result` array containing the top k frequent elements is returned.

## Time Complexity:
- Let n be the number of elements in the input array `nums`.
- Constructing the HashMap takes O(n) time.
- Constructing the PriorityQueue takes O(n * log(k)) time.
- Extracting the top k elements from the PriorityQueue takes O(k * log(k)) time.
- So, the overall time complexity is O(n + k * log(k)).

## Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(n) due to the HashMap used to store the frequency of each element.
