## Explanation:

This Java class `Solution` defines a method `maxPathSum` that calculates the maximum path sum in a binary tree. It utilizes a helper method `helper` to traverse the tree recursively. Here's a breakdown of the code:

- **`maxPathSum` Method:**
  - This method is the entry point for calculating the maximum path sum.
  - It calls the `helper` method passing the root node of the binary tree.
  - After the traversal is complete, it returns the `maxSum`.

- **`helper` Method:**
  - This method recursively traverses the binary tree in a depth-first manner.
  - It takes a `TreeNode` as input parameter.
  - If the current node is null, it returns 0.
  - It recursively calculates the maximum sum of the left and right subtrees by calling itself on the left and right child nodes.
  - It calculates the sum of the current node's value, the maximum sum of the left subtree, and the maximum sum of the right subtree.
  - Updates the `maxSum` if the current path sum is greater than the previous maximum sum.
  - Returns the maximum sum possible from the current node towards its parent.

## Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because the algorithm visits each node exactly once.

## Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of this algorithm is O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree. This is because the recursion stack can go as deep as the height of the tree.
