# Explanation of the code:

## Class Definition:
- Define a class named `Solution`.

## Method Definition:
- Define a public method named `removeNthFromEnd`.
- Parameters:
  - `head`: A reference to the head of a linked list (`ListNode` type).
  - `n`: An integer representing the position of the node to remove from the end of the list.

## Method Body:
- Create a new `ListNode` named `dummy` with value 0 and set its next node to `head`. This is used to handle the case where the node to be removed is the first node.
- Create two pointers, `fast` and `slow`, both initially pointing to the `dummy` node.
- Iterate `fast` pointer `n+1` times ahead of `slow`.
- Traverse both `fast` and `slow` pointers simultaneously until `fast` reaches the end of the list.
- At this point, `slow` points to the node preceding the one to be removed.
- Remove the node by updating the `next` reference of `slow` to skip the next node.
- Return the modified list starting from `dummy.next`, which effectively skips the dummy node.

## Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list twice: once to find the length and once to remove the node.
- Space Complexity: O(1). We only use constant extra space for two pointers.
