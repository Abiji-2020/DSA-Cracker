## Explanation:

This Java code constructs a binary tree from its preorder and inorder traversal sequences. It defines a class `Solution` with a method `buildTree` that takes two arrays: `preorder` and `inorder`, representing the preorder and inorder traversal sequences of the binary tree, respectively.

The `buildTree` method is overloaded with a private helper method that actually performs the construction of the binary tree recursively.

### Steps:

1. **Base Case Check**: If the start index of the preorder sequence exceeds the end index, or if the start index of the inorder sequence exceeds the end index, it means there are no elements to construct the tree, so it returns `null`.

2. **Identify Root**: It takes the first element of the preorder sequence as the root value.

3. **Find Root Index in Inorder**: It finds the index of the root value in the inorder sequence to determine the left and right subtrees.

4. **Construct Root Node**: It creates a `TreeNode` object with the root value.

5. **Calculate Left Subtree Size**: It calculates the size of the left subtree by subtracting the start index from the root index.

6. **Recursive Left Subtree Construction**: It recursively constructs the left subtree by passing appropriate indices.

7. **Recursive Right Subtree Construction**: It recursively constructs the right subtree by passing appropriate indices.

8. **Return Root**: It returns the root of the constructed binary tree.

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of constructing the binary tree using this approach is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because each node is processed exactly once.

### Space Complexity:

The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This space is used for the recursive function call stack during the construction of the binary tree.
