## Explanation of numDecodings method

### Parameters:
- `s`: A string containing only digits.

### Return Value:
- An integer representing the number of ways to decode the given string.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a dynamic programming array `dp` of size `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
2. If the input string is empty or starts with '0', return 0, as there's no valid decoding possible.
3. Initialize `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` to 1 since there is only one way to decode a string of length 0 or 1.
4. Iterate over the input string from index 2 to `n`:
   - Retrieve the current character `first` and the character before it `second`.
   - If `first` is not '0', increment `dp[i]` by `dp[i - 1]`, indicating that the current character can be decoded alone.
   - If `second` is '1' or '2' and `first` is less than or equal to '6', increment `dp[i]` by `dp[i - 2]`, indicating that the current character can be combined with the previous character for decoding.
5. Return `dp[n]`, which represents the total number of ways to decode the input string.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`, since we iterate over each character of the string once.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`, due to the dynamic programming array `dp`.
