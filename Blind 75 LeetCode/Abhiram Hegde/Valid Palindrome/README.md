**Explanation**:

1. The `isPalindrome` method takes a string `s` as input and returns `true` if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and `false` otherwise.

2. It initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, which start from the beginning and end of the string respectively.

3. It iterates over the string while the `left` pointer is less than the `right` pointer. During each iteration:
   - It checks if the characters at the `left` and `right` pointers are alphanumeric. If not, it moves the pointers inward until they point to alphanumeric characters.
   - It compares the characters at the `left` and `right` pointers. If they are not equal, it returns `false`, indicating that the string is not a palindrome.
   - If the characters are equal, it moves both pointers inward and continues the iteration.

4. If the loop completes without finding any unequal characters, it returns `true`, indicating that the string is a palindrome.

**Time Complexity**:
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because it iterates over the string once, and each iteration involves constant time operations.

**Space Complexity**:
- The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1), as it uses only a constant amount of extra space regardless of the size of the input string.
