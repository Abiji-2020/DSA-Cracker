Explanation:
- The code defines a class named `Solution` with a method `isValid` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the input string contains valid parentheses, braces, and brackets.
- Inside the method, a `Stack<Character>` named `stack` is initialized to store the opening parentheses, braces, and brackets encountered in the string.
- The method iterates through each character of the input string using a for-each loop.
- If the character is an opening parenthesis, brace, or bracket (`'('`, `'{'`, or `'['`), it is pushed onto the stack.
- If the character is a closing parenthesis, brace, or bracket (`')'`, `'}'`, or `']'`), the method checks if the stack is empty. If it is, there is no corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket, so the method returns `false`.
- If the stack is not empty, the top character of the stack is popped and compared with the current character to ensure that they form a valid pair of opening and closing brackets (`'('` and `')'`, `'{'` and `'}'`, or `'['` and `']'`). If they don't match, the method returns `false`.
- After processing all characters in the string, if the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets have been matched with closing brackets, so the method returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Time Complexity: O(n)
- The code iterates through each character of the input string once, where n is the length of the string. Therefore, the time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input string.

Space Complexity: O(n)
- In the worst case, where all characters in the input string are opening parentheses, braces, or brackets, the stack can contain up to n/2 elements. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).
