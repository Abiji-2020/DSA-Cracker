### Insert Interval into Sorted Intervals

#### Code Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is assigned the length of the `intervals` array.
   - `result` is initialized as a new 2D array with a length of `n + 1`. This array will hold the merged intervals.
   - Two variables `i` and `j` are initialized to 0. `i` is used to iterate through the intervals, and `j` is used to index the result array.

2. **Merge Intervals**:
   - The first `while` loop iterates over the intervals until the end of the array or until the end of an interval in `intervals` is less than the start of `newInterval`. During this iteration, the intervals that come before `newInterval` are directly added to the `result` array.
   
   - The second `while` loop is responsible for merging intervals. It iterates over the remaining intervals in `intervals` and checks if there's any overlap with `newInterval`. If there's an overlap:
     - The start of `newInterval` is updated to the minimum of its current start and the start of the overlapping interval.
     - The end of `newInterval` is updated to the maximum of its current end and the end of the overlapping interval.
     - `i` is incremented to move to the next interval.

3. **Adding Merged Interval**:
   - After merging intervals, the merged `newInterval` is added to the `result` array at index `j`.

4. **Add Remaining Intervals**:
   - Finally, the remaining intervals from `intervals` are added to the `result` array.

5. **Return Result**:
   - The function returns a copy of the `result` array up to index `j`, which contains the merged intervals.

#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of intervals in the input array. This is because each interval is processed only once.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of intervals in the input array. This is because the `result` array can potentially hold all the intervals from the input plus the merged interval.
