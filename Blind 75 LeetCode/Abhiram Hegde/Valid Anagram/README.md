## Explanation of isAnagram Method

This method determines whether two strings `s` and `t` are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.

1. **Length Check**: 
   - If the lengths of the two strings `s` and `t` are not equal, they cannot be anagrams, so the method returns `false`.

2. **Character Counting**:
   - An array `charCount` of size 26 (representing the lowercase English alphabet) is initialized to store the count of each character in the first string `s`.
   - For each character `c` in string `s`, the count of character `c` is incremented in the `charCount` array by using its ASCII value as the index (`c - 'a'`).

3. **Character Decrementing and Validation**:
   - For each character `c` in string `t`, the count of character `c` in the `charCount` array is decremented.
   - If the count becomes negative after decrementing or if the character `c` is not present in string `s`, it means `t` has more occurrences of character `c` than `s`, hence they cannot be anagrams, and the method returns `false`.

4. **Return**:
   - If the method completes the loops without returning `false`, it means both strings have the same characters with the same counts, so they are anagrams, and the method returns `true`.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this method is O(n), where n is the length of the input strings `s` and `t`. This is because the method iterates through both strings once.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity of this method is O(1) since the size of the `charCount` array (26) remains constant regardless of the size of the input strings. Thus, the space complexity is constant.
