Explanation:
- The `isSubtree` method checks if `subRoot` is a subtree of `root`. It traverses the tree rooted at `root` and for each node, it checks if `subRoot` can be found starting from that node.
- The method first checks if `root` is null. If it is, it returns false, indicating that `subRoot` cannot be a subtree of a null tree.
- If the value of the current node in `root` matches the value of the root of `subRoot`, it calls the `isSameTree` method to check if the trees rooted at the current node of `root` and at `subRoot` are the same.
- If they are the same, it returns true, indicating that `subRoot` is a subtree of `root`.
- If they are not the same, it continues searching for `subRoot` in the left and right subtrees of `root` recursively.
- The `isSameTree` method checks if two trees are identical. It recursively checks if the values of the corresponding nodes are equal and if their left and right subtrees are also identical.

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the `isSubtree` method depends on the size of the `root` tree and the `subRoot` tree. Let `m` be the number of nodes in the `root` tree and `n` be the number of nodes in the `subRoot` tree.
- In the worst case, each node in the `root` tree might need to be checked for equality with the `subRoot` tree. Thus, the time complexity is O(m * n), where `m` is the number of nodes in the `root` tree and `n` is the number of nodes in the `subRoot` tree.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(max(m, n)), where `m` is the number of nodes in the `root` tree and `n` is the number of nodes in the `subRoot` tree. This space is used for the recursive calls on the call stack.
