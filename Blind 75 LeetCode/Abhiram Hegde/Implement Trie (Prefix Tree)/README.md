# Trie Class Explanation

## Overview
The Trie class is a data structure used to store a set of strings efficiently. It supports operations such as insertion, search, and prefix search.

## Class Structure
- **Trie class**: This is the main class representing the Trie data structure. It contains methods for insertion (`insert`), searching for a complete word (`search`), and searching for a prefix (`startsWith`). Additionally, it has a private method `searchPrefix` to assist in prefix searching.
- **TrieNode class**: This is an inner class representing each node in the Trie. Each node contains an array of TrieNode children, representing possible next characters, and a boolean flag `isEnd` indicating whether the node represents the end of a complete word.

## Methods
1. **insert(String word)**:
   - Inserts the given `word` into the Trie.
   - It traverses the Trie character by character, creating new nodes if necessary, until the entire word is inserted.
   - Finally, it marks the last node as the end of a word by setting `isEnd` to true.

2. **search(String word)**:
   - Searches for the complete `word` in the Trie.
   - It traverses the Trie character by character, checking if each character exists as a child of the current node.
   - If the entire word is found and the node representing the last character has `isEnd` set to true, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

3. **startsWith(String prefix)**:
   - Checks if there exists any word in the Trie that starts with the given `prefix`.
   - It uses the `searchPrefix` method to traverse the Trie with the prefix and returns true if the traversal reaches a valid node (i.e., not null).

4. **searchPrefix(String prefix)** (private):
   - Helper method for `startsWith`.
   - It traverses the Trie with the given `prefix`, character by character.
   - If any character is not found in the Trie or the traversal reaches a null node, it returns null, indicating that no word in the Trie starts with the given prefix.
   - Otherwise, it returns the node representing the last character of the prefix.

## TrieNode Class
- Represents a node in the Trie data structure.
- Each node has an array `children` of size 26 (for lowercase English letters) to store references to its child nodes.
- The `isEnd` flag indicates whether the node represents the end of a complete word.

## Usage
To use the Trie class, instantiate an object of Trie and then call its methods, such as `insert`, `search`, and `startsWith`.
