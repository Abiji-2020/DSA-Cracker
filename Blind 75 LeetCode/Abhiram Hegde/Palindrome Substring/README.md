**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `n`: Stores the length of the input string `s`.
   - `count`: Initializes a variable to keep track of the total number of palindromic substrings (initially 0).
   - `dp`: Creates a 2D boolean array `dp` of size `n x n`. This array will be used for dynamic programming to efficiently determine if a substring is a palindrome.

2. **Single Character Substrings:**
   - The loop iterates through the diagonal elements of `dp` (`i = j`).
   - Since single characters are always palindromes, `dp[i][i]` is set to `true`.
   - The `count` is incremented by 1 for each single character palindrome.

3. **Substrings of Length 2:**
   - The loop iterates through substrings of length 2 (pairs of adjacent characters).
   - If the characters at indices `i` and `i + 1` are the same, it means the substring is a palindrome.
   - `dp[i][i + 1]` is set to `true`.
   - The `count` is incremented by 1.

4. **Substrings of Length 3 or More (Dynamic Programming):**
   - The outer loop iterates through possible substring lengths (`k`), starting from 3 (`k = 2`) and going up to `n` (the maximum length).
   - The inner loop iterates through all possible starting positions (`i`) for substrings of length `k`.
   - `j` is calculated as `i + k`, representing the ending index of the current substring.
   - The condition `s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)` checks if the first and last characters of the substring match.
   - `dp[i + 1][j - 1]` checks if the substring between `i + 1` and `j - 1` (excluding the first and last characters) is already marked as a palindrome in the `dp` array. This leverages the fact that if a larger substring is a palindrome, its proper sub-substrings must also be palindromes.
   - If both conditions are met, the current substring (`i` to `j`) is a palindrome.
   - `dp[i][j]` is set to `true`.
   - The `count` is incremented by 1.

5. **Return Result:**
   - The function returns the final `count` of palindromic substrings found in the string `s`.

**Time Complexity:**

- The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n^3)**.
- The outer loop iterates `n` times for different substring lengths (`k`).
- The inner loop iterates up to `n - k` times for possible starting positions (`i`).
- Within the inner loop, there are constant time operations like character comparisons and array accesses.
- However, the nested loops lead to a cubic overall complexity.

**Space Complexity:**

- The space complexity of this algorithm is **O(n^2)**.
- The `dp` array stores boolean values for all possible substrings, requiring `n x n` space.
