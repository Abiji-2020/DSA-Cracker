## Explanation of Spiral Order Traversal Algorithm

### Method Signature
- **Method Name**: `spiralOrder`
- **Parameters**: `int[][] matrix`
- **Return Type**: `List<Integer>`

### Algorithm Explanation
1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize variables `rows` and `cols` to store the number of rows and columns in the matrix.
   - Create an empty list `result` to store the elements of the matrix in spiral order.
   - Initialize variables `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix.

2. **Traversal**:
   - Iterate while `left` is less than or equal to `right` and `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`.
   - Traverse the top row from `left` to `right`, adding each element to the `result` list.
   - Increment `top` to move to the next row.
   - Traverse the right column from `top` to `bottom`, adding each element to the `result` list.
   - Decrement `right` to move to the previous column.
   - Check if `top` is still less than or equal to `bottom`.
     - If true, traverse the bottom row from `right` to `left`, adding each element to the `result` list, and decrement `bottom`.
   - Check if `left` is still less than or equal to `right`.
     - If true, traverse the left column from `bottom` to `top`, adding each element to the `result` list, and increment `left`.

3. **Return Result**: 
   - Once traversal is complete, return the `result` list containing the elements of the matrix in spiral order.


### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), excluding the space required for the output list.
