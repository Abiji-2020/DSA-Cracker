## Explanation:

The given Java code implements a method `groupAnagrams` that takes an array of strings `strs` as input and returns a list of lists where each inner list contains strings that are anagrams of each other.

1. **Initialization**: 
   - A `HashMap` named `map` is initialized to store the sorted string as key and a list of anagrams as value.

2. **Iterating Over Input Strings**:
   - The code iterates over each string in the input array `strs`.

3. **Sorting and Grouping**:
   - For each string, it converts it to a character array and sorts it. This sorted string serves as the key to group anagrams together.
   - If the sorted string is not present in the map, a new ArrayList is created and put into the map with the sorted string as key.
   - The original string is then added to the list corresponding to its sorted version.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - After processing all input strings, the method returns a new ArrayList containing all the values from the map, which are lists of grouped anagrams.

## Time Complexity:
- Let n be the total number of characters in all strings combined.
- Sorting each string takes O(k log k) time, where k is the average length of the strings.
- Since we iterate over each string once, the overall time complexity is O(n * log k).

## Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(n) for storing the input strings.
- Additionally, the space complexity of the HashMap `map` is O(m), where m is the number of unique sorted strings (i.e., the number of groups of anagrams).
- Thus, the total space complexity is O(n + m).
