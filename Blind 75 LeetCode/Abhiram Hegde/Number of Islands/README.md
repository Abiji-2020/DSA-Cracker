## Explanation of numIslands Method

The `numIslands` method takes a 2D character array `grid` representing a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water) as input and returns the number of islands in the grid.

1. **Edge Case Handling**: 
    - It first checks if the input `grid` is null or empty. If so, it returns 0, indicating that there are no islands in the grid.

2. **Initialization**:
    - It initializes variables `count`, `m`, and `n`. 
        - `count` is used to store the count of islands found.
        - `m` and `n` represent the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

3. **Grid Traversal**:
    - It iterates through each cell of the grid using nested loops.
        - For each cell:
            - If the cell contains '1', indicating land, it calls the `dfs` method to perform depth-first search traversal to mark the current island and increments the `count` of islands.

4. **DFS Method**:
    - The `dfs` method performs depth-first search traversal starting from a given cell `(i, j)`.
        - It checks if the current cell `(i, j)` is out of bounds or if it is not land ('1'). If so, it returns, terminating the recursion.
        - Otherwise, it marks the current cell as visited by changing its value to '0'.
        - It then recursively calls itself on adjacent cells - up, down, left, and right, to explore the island.

5. **Return Count**:
    - Finally, it returns the `count`, which represents the total number of islands found in the grid.

The algorithm traverses each cell of the grid once and performs DFS to mark each island, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(m*n), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid.
