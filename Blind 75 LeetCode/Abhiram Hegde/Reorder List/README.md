### Explanation of reorderList Function

This function reorders the nodes of a given linked list such that the first node is followed by the last node, the second node is followed by the second to last node, and so on.

1. **Initialization:**
    - If the given linked list is empty or has only one node, there's no need to reorder it, so the function returns.
    - Two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, are initialized to the head of the linked list.

2. **Finding the Middle:**
    - The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time while the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time until the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list. At this point, the `slow` pointer will be at the middle node (or just before the middle in case of an even-length list).

3. **Reversing the Second Half:**
    - Once the middle node is found, the function reverses the second half of the list starting from the node after the middle node.
    - `prev`, `curr`, and `next` pointers are used to reverse the pointers of the nodes.

4. **Breaking the List into Two Parts:**
    - After reversing, the `slow.next` is set to `null` to break the list into two separate lists.

5. **Merging Two Lists:**
    - Finally, the function merges the first half and the reversed second half of the list by alternating nodes from each half.

6. **Complexity:**
    - The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, as it traverses the list only twice.
