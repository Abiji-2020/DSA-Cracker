Explanation:
- This Java class `Solution` defines a method `isValidBST` to check if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST).
- The method `isValidBST(TreeNode root)` is a public method that serves as an entry point. It calls the private helper method `isValidBST(TreeNode node, long lowerBound, long upperBound)` with the root node of the tree and the minimum and maximum possible values for a node's value.
- The private helper method `isValidBST` takes three parameters: the current node being evaluated, the lower bound for valid values, and the upper bound for valid values.
- If the current node is null, it means the subtree is valid, so it returns `true`.
- If the value of the current node is not within the range defined by `lowerBound` and `upperBound`, it returns `false`, indicating that the subtree is not a valid BST.
- Recursively, it checks the left subtree with updated upper bound (which becomes the value of the current node) and the right subtree with updated lower bound (which becomes the value of the current node).
- If both the left and right subtrees are valid BSTs, then the current subtree is also a valid BST, and it returns `true`.

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because it visits each node exactly once.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the height of the binary tree. This is because the recursion stack can go as deep as the height of the tree, which is O(n) in the worst case for an unbalanced tree, but it is O(log n) on average for a balanced binary tree.
