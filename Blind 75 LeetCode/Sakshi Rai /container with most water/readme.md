This is a C++ code that defines a class Solution with a public method maxArea, which takes a vector of integers representing the heights 
of vertical lines. The method uses a two-pointer approach to find the maximum area between two lines that can be formed with a vertical line
on the left and another on the right. It initializes two pointers, start and end, at the beginning and end of the vector, respectively. It
iteratively calculates the area between the lines represented by the pointers, updates the maximum area if the current area is greater, and 
then moves the pointers towards each other based on the height of the lines. The process continues until the pointers meet, and the maximum 
area is returned.
